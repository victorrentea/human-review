"""Serve .human-review/ on loopback and print the report's URL.

The guide is finished work that someone reads; `open review.html` hands it to
whatever the OS thinks owns .html — another application, on whatever desktop it
happens to live on, while the terminal that built it is inside an editor. Both of
VS Code's embedded browsers can show it instead, but neither will load a
`file://` URL: the Simple Browser's iframe is bound by a `frame-src *` CSP, and a
CSP wildcard does not cover non-network schemes, so a file URL renders as a blank
panel with no error. Serving the directory is what makes the report addressable.

The server is deliberately small and mortal:

- **loopback only.** The guide quotes source, names people from CODEOWNERS, and
  deep-links a working tree. It is not for the network.
- **it exits on its own.** `.human-review/` is a throwaway, and a static server
  left running until the next reboot is a worse artifact than the folder it
  serves. Idle for `--idle-minutes` and it is gone.
- **a second run reuses the first.** Re-rendering the report and re-serving it is
  the normal loop; each run leaving another listener behind is not.

Usage:
  serve-review.py .human-review                      # prints the base URL
  serve-review.py .human-review --page review.html   # prints the page URL
  serve-review.py .human-review --stop
